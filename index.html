                <h1>Why Yoga?</h1>
                <p class="first-caps" dir="ltr">Yoga योग is the foundation on which we can reach a life of enlightenment, freedom, fearlessness, and unconditional infinite love and kindness. Yoga is for Life.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Practicing Yoga in its entirety is like eating a broad and healthy diet. The physical exercises such as Asanas आसन (postures), Pranayama प्राणायाम (breathing and energy exercises), and Mudras मुद्रा tackle chronic illness such as back pain, abdominal or sleep disorders and clear the way for Yoga&rsquo;s more profound practices of Dhyana ध्यान, Dharana धारणा and Samadhi 	समाधि. These last three aspects of Yoga might be simplistically labelled &ldquo;meditation&rdquo;, and these are the only components that take us towards a new life of enlightenment.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Through meditation we can explore many things which we may not even be aware of in our current state of mind. Virtues of unconditional love, kindness, compassion and mercy.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Having built up these virtues in ourselves we can put them into action through Karma कर्म, Bhakti	भक्ति  and Jnana 	ज्ञान Yoga. Our interactions with the world through our daily work, our behaviour and our thoughts have a lasting impact on not only our lives, but the lives of those around us as well.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">So Yoga is a complete system for life. Yoga is for our body, mind, and soul. Yoga is for sick people, Yoga is for healthy people and happy people. Yoga is for people of all levels. Yoga is for prenatal infants, pregnant women, newborns, children, adults, middle aged people, and elderly. Even on the deathbed, gratefulness and Yogic principles can help transition to a better state of consciousness.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Yoga can give meaning and purpose to life. Instead of mindless, mechanical eating we see the purpose, &lsquo;I need to eat for my health and happiness so I can do good in the world and live a life of greater peace, quality, and harmony.&rsquo;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">At the root of Yoga is Sadhana (practice), and the fruit of Yoga is also Sadhana. This practice is the ongoing research into our lives and the meaning of our existence across all dimensions, not only the physical.</p>

                    "I found your holistic (combination of stretching, meditation and breathing) and personalised approach really useful. Your yoga class was the treat/luxury of the week. I also loved how you slipped / introduced little learnings/teachings about life into the verbal communications you had with us while we were exercising; you always taught us something about how to approach life in a healthy and happy way.
                    We loved your classes! It also felt like a family and you played a key role in creating that environment.
                    The class was so complete in the sense that we worked at so many different levels (mind body and heart!) plus I loves your chanting at the end."
                    <i>-Alicia Renedo (Spain)</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I did yoga classes with Kamal for about five years, they were fantastic. I couldn't recommend him enough. In fact I did recommend him to some friends who have since carried on to a much more advanced level with Kamal." <i>-Michael Mariott (London, UK)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Your teaching is truly exceptional, very open, kind, cooperative and versatile, especially when it comes to teaching children and families. From my own experience I learnt a lot about myself as your teaching reaches inside and gently reflects not only the weak areas for further improvement but constantly discovers the strengths within. From my early childhood up to now, I met a few sincere, dedicated, wise and caring People and Teaches - you are the one who taught me yoga and you and your family have a special place in my heart. Thank you." <i>-Yana Reznik (Russia)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Kamal is a joy to be with and to receive his teachings on the mysteries of the Yogic tradition is a privilege.  Kamal brings an authenticity to his yoga practice having grown up in the Himalayas and been exposed to a yogic tradition from a young age.   He has a breadth of knowledge on all the different aspects of yoga and has dedicated his life to this practice. He is also full of humour and curiosity of life which makes each class different. I love being taught by Yogi Kamal." <i>-Tom Sessions (Yorkshire, UK)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kamal is both a wonderful person and excellent yoga teacher. He has been living and breathing yoga from a very early age and is steeped in its traditions from growing up in Nepal and his training in India.

                    His light and funny manner plus the depth and breadth of his understanding of all aspects of yoga are profound and were lifechanging for me.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My first experience of his teaching was in Kathmandu in early 2000.  His patience and generosity were far more than I had ever experienced as we muddled through classes with his then limited English and my limited yoga.
                    
                    I have since had the good fortune to experience classes with Kamal in both Australia and Nepal and would jump at any opportunity to attend classes in London.

                    In home gurukulam the house becomes an ashram, a living institute of Yoga, meditation and spirituality for the exploration of life.
                    <br/><br/>
                    With dedication and commitment from both sides, we use this private time to fulfill the inner quest of Yoga to enhance our human values of love and kindness, hope and happiness, mercy and divinity.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In this setting the teacher is able to work much more closely with the individual's physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs.
