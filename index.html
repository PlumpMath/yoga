                    Kamal was born in the Himalayas and has been teaching Yoga since he was 16 years old, having practiced Yoga from a very young age as taught by his father, he went on to study Yoga and philosophy at University. Since Kamal moved to London (how many years ago?) he teaches elderly in care homes, children in schools, group classes, and a few private students. Kamal has a loving wife Junco who practices and teaches yoga for natural childbirth, and together they have two children who are also keen yoga practitioners!

                <p>
                    Kamal is very humble, and at first glance, on listening to his playful use of language, many might overlook his deep spiritual understanding of Yoga. He speaks 6 languages, is learning Japanese, and is extremely well read in ancient Sanskrit texts as well as classical western literature. He will answer your questions on deep levels that resonate with truth and insight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly Kamal practices what he teaches. He is loving and compassionate, a quality one feels as soon as they meet him, he never exudes anger or fear and he is very open and asking of criticism to improve himself. His teaching and practice of yoga is of much more than the Asanas (postures) that we might associate with Yoga, they extend to every aspect of life. He has travelled and learned from many great masters of the Himalayas, but has left the peaceful retreats of the hermitages and caves where other yogis dwell, and thrown himself in the deep end, to help those most in need of his teachings. He has helped reform people who would sleep all day, people with alcohol or drug problems, and people who had lost all hope. It would be his greatest joy to really help just 5 people in his lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the 'Lotus' flower that his name signifies in Sanskrit, Kamal is bright and cheerful amid the greys of our modern London life; he brings happiness and joy to those around him and I am so grateful to have him as my teacher.

                    I found your holistic (combination of stretchering, meditation and breathing) and personalised approach really useful. Your yoga class was the treat/luxury of the week. I also loved how you slipped / introduced little learnings/teachings about life into the verbal communications you had with us while we were exercising; you always taught us something about how to approach life in a healthy and happy way.
                    We loved your classes! It also felt like a family and you played a key role in creating that environment.
                    The class was so complete in the sense that we worked at so many different levels (mind body and heart!) plus I loves your chanting at the end.

                    I did yoga classes with Kamal for about five years, they were fantastic. I couldn't recommend him enough. In fact I did recommend him to some friends who have since carried on to a much more advanced level with Kamal. -Michael Mariott

                    Your teaching is truly exceptional, very open, kind, cooperative and versatile, especially when it comes to teaching children and families. From my own experience I learnt a lot about myself as your teaching reaches inside and gently reflects not only the weak areas for further improvement but constantly discovers the strengths within. From my early childhood up to now, I met a few sincere, dedicated, wise and caring People and Teaches - you are the one who taught me yoga and you and your family have a special place in my heart. Thank you. - Yana Reznik

                    Kamal is a joy to be with and to receive his teachings on the mysteries of the Yogic tradition is a privilege.  Kamal brings an authenticity to his yoga practice having grown up in the Himalayas and been exposed to a yogic tradition from a young age.   He has a breadth of knowledge on all the different aspects of yoga and has dedicated his life to this practice. He is also full of humour and curiosity of life which makes each class different. I love being taught by Yogi Kamal.- Tom Sessions
